## v0.7.0 (October 4, 2015)

D3Funnel v0.7 is a **backwards-incompatible** release that resolves some
outstanding bugs, standardizes several option names and formats, and introduces
a few new features.

No new features will be added to the v0.6 series, but minor patches will be
available for a few months.

### Behavior Changes

* [#29]: Dynamic block heights are no longer determined by their weighted area, but by their weighted height
	* Heights determined by weighted area: http://jsfiddle.net/zq4L82kv/2/ (legacy v0.6.x)
	* Heights determined by weighted height: http://jsfiddle.net/bawv6m0j/1/ (v0.7+)

### New Features

* [#9]: Block can now have their color scale specified in addition to data points
* [#34]: Default options are now statically available and overridable

### Bug Fixes

* [#25]: Fix issues with `isInverted` and `dynamicArea` producing odd pyramids
